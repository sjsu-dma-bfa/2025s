        <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
        <hr>
        <p id="statement">The conceptual foundation of this work challenges the divide between the natural and
          human-made worlds. Devyn invites viewers to reconsider how nature is reimagined through art and technology,
          suggesting that even our most technological creations cannot fully separate the essence of nature. Through
          this piece, the artist reflects on our evolving relationship with the environment and encourages a deeper
          reflection on humanity's impact on the natural world. Nature can make us feel incredibly small and yet makes
          us feel deeply connected to something greater than ourselves. While the natural world is visually stunning, it
          is often abstracted and reinterpreted through human influence. The sculpture, made from layers of chipboard
          cut into designs inspired by Devyn's illustrations, challenges the traditional separation between nature and
          human-made objects. It questions the assumption that nature is pure and untouched, while human creations are
          considered unnatural. This work invites viewers to reconsider their understanding of nature, what imagery
          comes to mind when you think of nature, and how does that differ from manmade objects? Is there truly a clear
          distinction between the two? Can altered images and structures based on natural elements still retain nature's
          essence? By blending laser cutting technology with natural imagery, this piece explores how humans manipulate
          nature through art, technology, and industry. It raises the question: Can something created with technology
          still embody the essence of nature? Ultimately, this artwork invites reflection on how we experience and
          reshape the natural world, challenging the idea that we can ever truly separate nature from human influence.
