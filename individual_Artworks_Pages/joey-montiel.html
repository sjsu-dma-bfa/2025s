        <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
        <hr>
        <p id="statement">Fashion is more than threads and fabric. It can be a language, a reflection of self identity, and a powerful form of expression. The way we dress can influence our feelings but also the way others perceive us. We can communicate to others aspects of our personalities or even emotions without a word. It becomes unspoken dialogue, shaping the ways we connect with others in the world around us. Fashion is often the first thing that people notice about you, influencing their judgement about who you are as a person.
          <br><br>
          My Dress Up is a hand-drawn javascript game that invites players to a space of creativity through the use of my personal closet. This interactive experience encourages players to use their judgement and dictate what they believe I should wear. What looks the best? What looks the worst? Fashion is subjective. This game explores the balance between personal style and social perception as players help me decide what to wear – curating their own identity into the outfits they choose for me. 
          <br><br>
          I created this game because of my peaking interest in fashion. After COVID-19, I personally delved into the world of fashion which gave me an outlet to show my creativity without having to say anything. It gave me a way to communicate with others about who I am, even if the way I dressed received judgement. Fashion has a way of transforming people, the wearer and the viewer. People will judge others based on their own standards forgetting that all art, including this one, is subjective. 
          <br><br>
          My Dress Up is more than a game, it is an open conversation about self-expression, identity, and the transformative powers of fashion. </p>
