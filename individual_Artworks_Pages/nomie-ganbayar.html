        <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
        <hr>
        <p id="statement">Nomadverse, is a personal and cultural exploration of identity through the fusion of Mongolian
          nomadic heritage and futuristic digital aesthetics. This project is born from my own journey that is deeply
          tied to my roots, yet constantly evolving in a world driven by technology and innovation. As a Mongolian
          artist raised among traditional values and ancestral stories, I have always felt a responsibility toward
          preserving and honoring the richness of my culture. Simultaneously, I find myself immersed in the digital
          landscape of today, curious, inspired, and navigating my sense of self as a “Cyber Nomad.” This duality fuels
          Nomadverse, a space where the past and future coexist, and where cultural symbolism meets cyberpunk
          sensibilities. Through 3D modeling, I create immersive digital environments and characters that merge
          Mongolian landscapes, attire, and mythology with reimagined sci-fi features. The project is as much about
          preservation as it is about reinterpretation—reflecting how tradition can evolve without being lost.
          Nomadverse is not just a visual experience, it is a call to reflect on where we come from and where we are
          going. It is inviting viewers to imagine a future where heritage is not forgotten, but reimagined and
          celebrated. Drawing inspiration from sources like Mongolian folklore, my own lived experience, and even modern
          interpretations like Padmé Amidala's Mongolian-influenced designs in Star Wars, I aim to illustrate the fluid
          and adaptive nature of cultural identity.</p>

        <h1>Artist Biography</h1>
        <hr style="width: 100%;">
        <p id="bio">Nomin (Nomie) Ganbayar is a digital media artist based in Oakland, California. She’s currently a student at San Jose State University, where she’s working toward a BFA in Digital Media Art. Art has always been a constant in her life, something she turned to for comfort and self-expression. Over time, she found that the digital space gave her the freedom to fully explore her creativity.
          Nomin’s work is deeply personal, often shaped by moments from her own life and spiritual journey. She’s drawn to the unknown, using technology and digital tools to capture fleeting feelings and experiences in a way that feels both intimate and expansive.
          Growing up with a strong connection to her Mongolian heritage, Nomin often incorporates cultural references and symbolism into her pieces. Her work is inspired by the stories and traditions passed down through her family, as well as her love for science fiction, fantasy, spirituality, and philosophy. These influences come together to form a visual style that’s reflective, otherworldly, and grounded in identity.
          At the heart of her practice is a desire to create spaces for reflection and meaning. Whether through a single artwork or an immersive installation, Nomin hopes to inspire others to pause, feel, and explore their own paths through art.</p>
