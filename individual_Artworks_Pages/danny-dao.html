        <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
        <hr>
        <p id="statement">All life ceases to exist one day; thus, it is important to create… to maintain a memory deep
          within the mind. Dispersion is an immersive interactive installation that uses four of the five human senses -
          hearing, sight, smell, and touch all within a moment to create a spectacle on the screen. By blending physical
          objects with digital elements through the use of energy produced in living objects, the project creates a
          captivating sensory experience that bridges the gap between the tangible and digital worlds. Dispersion
          represents my constant chase of maintaining the balance of the real and digital world. I spend a lot of my
          time through the use of technology, but I still yearn for the ability to reach out to the world around me.
          Social connections, face to face and the interactive surrounding environment through nature seems to always be
          missing from everyday life. As I try to search for connection through the human senses, sound has been the
          most important factor in connecting with the world around me. Each flower in this project represents not only
          an emotion, but a journey up until this very moment. The feelings manifested through every living being serves
          as a purpose to gravitate towards a mutual object in hopes of life. I am fascinated by the homologous nature
          of living things to constantly attune to the world around them. As I search for this connection through this
          project, I hope that I can connect the digital world along with it. Technology, through its use of energy can
          also do the same. I believe that it yearns to be connected to the real world too.</p>
