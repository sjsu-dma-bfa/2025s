        <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
        <hr>
        <p id="statement">A world far from our own, or is it? I set out to make untitled a unique auditory and visually
          sensory chasm. A “reality marble, ”a world cut off from our own and based on my perception of reality. My
          viewers will become spectators if they wish to view my world. At the “booth, ”there will only be a chair, VR
          goggles, and headphones. Put them on, sit down, and absorb. It is all I ask of my spectators, to view, to
          gaze, to listen, to observe. Upon immersing and becoming part of the world, you realize you are only a
          bystander. The VR world is saturated with flora of jungle and ruins, time is a character, buildings are empty,
          a society long gone. Things are all around you, in front of you, but can't move, you can't reach out. A world
          that has ended, could be one of the many things someone can derive from participating. My plans for the
          exhibition include using VR technology to allow the viewers/ participants to be transported to an abstract 3D
          world I will have created. The space I require is localized, as much of my exhibition and experience is done
          with the VR headset. I have now come to reach my final destination. Giving the viewers a virtual 3D world of
          my machinations. Using VR & Unity, the participants will be exposed to another reality.</p>

        <h1>Artist Biography</h1>
        <hr style="width: 100%;">
        <p id="bio">Where it all started with video games. My first ever memories of being alive were memories of
          me playing video games with my father in the corner of his room; we would be playing on a
          PlayStation 2 connected to a big and heavy gray box tv. I remember being completely enthralled
          by the sheer scale of the video games I played. The colors, the setting, the conversations, the
          characters; each game had something to tell, something to show. Each with their own unique
          rules and limitations. It had always stunned me since that video games were so potent in
          delivering so many different ideas, themes, messages, and styles. Video games as a medium,
          seemed endless for unlimited potential. It is as if video games were water and could take on any
          shape for form that was to be presented. I had learned so much from all my games, and now
          recognize later as an adult that I take on a lot of my personality, traits, and behaviors from the
          games I played. I owe a lot of gratitude to games, as I think they help make a foundation of my
          identity.</p>
