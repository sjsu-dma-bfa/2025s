        <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
        <hr>
        <p id="statement">"Exploring the Depths: A Boy's AR Adventure with Sea Life" is a project that merges 3D
          animation, augmented reality (AR), and environmental awareness. Through the lens of a young boy's passion for
          exploration, the p roject brings the ocean's hidden beauty to life by blending animated sea creatures and
          plants with real-world objects. Created using Blender, Sravya's artwork highlights the vibrant ecosystems of
          the ocean and emphasizes the importance of preserving these delicate environments. Driven by her passion for
          the convergence of technology, art, and nature, Sravya seeks to explore how animation and AR can turn abstract
          ideas into immersive experiences. The ocean acts as both a creative inspiration and a challenge for digital
          depiction due to its ever-changing ecosystems and fluid nature. In the video, she created a character who
          views a video illustration through an AR device, presenting the underwater world in a way that promotes
          environmental awareness and highlights the importance of clean water and marine life conservation. This
          project reflects Sravya's desire to use technology not only for artistic expression but also to foster a
          deeper connection with nature. By immersing viewers in a digitally enhanced ocean environment, she hopes to
          inspire meaningful conversations about the preservation of our ecosystems. Ultimately, the project seeks to
          showcase how art and technology can come together to raise awareness and make a positive impact on the world.
