        <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
        <hr>
        <p id="statement">For my BFA project, I made something like a digital Theremin using Max/MSP. A Theremin is a
          special musical instrument that you don't touch to play. Instead, you move your hands in the air, and it makes
          sounds. I wanted to make one that works with a webcam and plays piano sounds instead of just beeps. Here's how
          it works: I use the webcam to watch where a person's hand is on the screen. The computer looks at where your
          hand is and uses that to decide what note to play. If your hand is high on the screen, the note will be high.
          If it's low, the note will be lower, just like going up and down on a piano. I also made it so that the sound
          is a piano instead of just a sine wave (which sounds like a simple beep). That makes it sound more real and
          musical. The patch also shows the person where their hand is being tracked, so they know how to move to make
          the sounds they want. This project helps people learn how music and computers can work together. It's also
          helpful for people who might not be able to play a regular piano with their hands. They can move in the air
          and still make music. I used objects in Max/MSP like jit.pwindow to show video and noteout~ to help with
          sound. I also mapped the position to MIDI notes to make the piano play.</p>

        <h1>Artist Biography</h1>
        <hr style="width: 100%;">
        <p id="bio">Art has always been my escape—my way of navigating the world through creativity. I first discovered my love for art at the age of five, doodling on my homework despite getting in trouble for it. What once was a childhood habit has now become an integral part of my creative process, guiding me toward new artistic endeavors. For me, creating art is a delicate balance between focus and distraction. Immersing myself in the process allows ideas to flow naturally, while moments of spontaneity help me see my work from new perspectives. Sometimes, I create without a clear direction, embracing the uncertainty as part of my unique process. Beyond drawing, I have expanded my skills into videography, video editing, digital overlays for media streamers, photo editing, and digital art. My work is not just about the final outcome—it's about conveying emotion and meaning, allowing my audience to connect with the stories within my art. Art, to me, is more than a form of expression; it is a universal language—one that transcends boundaries, challenges perceptions, and communicates the ineffable. My creative work is deeply influenced by cartoon characters, blending familiar styles with her own unique twist. My theme is fun and silly. 
          With every creation, I invite my viewers into my imaginative world, where the line between reality and fantasy is beautifully blurred. As I continue to explore and refine my craft, I do my best to stay committed to artistic growth and aspires to expand my online presence and career as a digital artist.</p>
